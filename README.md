# Shvaas
Shvaas (Breath in English) is an indoor air quality monitoring system with some additional semsors for environment monitoring.
# Problem
How can we know if we are breathing good air ? There has to be a way to make sure that we have the best living environment in our home.
From what I understand measure of air quality can be divided into three main factors 
1) Carbon Dioxide
    - CO2 is a natually occuring gas in most cases harmless but it is the level of CO2 that could casue health issue
    - normal atmosphereic level is 400 PPM .
    - Indoor level with no side effects is 400 - 1000 PPM
    - 1000 - 2000 PPM casues drowsiness, mild discomfort and reduced concentraion
    - 2000 - 5000 PPM casues headached, dizziness shortness of breath and increased heart rate could lead to unconsiousness 
2) Particulate Matter size
    - Size of particulate matters a lot for healthy lungs and organs in general.
3) Volatile Organic Compound (Chemicals that easily evaporate into the air at room temperature such as paints, cleaning products etc.)
    - There are harmful VOCs and there are harmless VOCs. It looks like electronically identifying them might be very difficult !
    - Industry seem to have taken simpler approch where it just shows the ppb or some version of it in the air. The sensors available in the market seems to react to any composition changes in the air.
