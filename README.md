# Shvaas
Shvaas (Breath in English) is an indoor air quality monitoring system with some additional sensors for environment monitoring.
# Problem
How can we know if we are breathing good air ? There has to be a way to make sure that we have the best living environment in our home.
From what I understand measure of air quality can be divided into three main factors 
1) Carbon Dioxide
    - CO2 is a naturally occurring gas in most cases harmless but it is the level of CO2 that could cause health issue
    - normal atmospheric level is 400 PPM .
    - Indoor level with no side effects is 400 - 1000 PPM
    - 1000 - 2000 PPM causes drowsiness, mild discomfort and reduced concentration
    - 2000 - 5000 PPM causes headaches, dizziness shortness of breath and increased heart rate could lead to unconsciousness 
2) Particulate Matter size
    - Size of particulate matters a lot for healthy lungs and organs in general.
3) Volatile Organic Compound (Chemicals that easily evaporate into the air at room temperature such as paints, cleaning products etc.)
    - There are harmful VOCs and there are harmless VOCs. It looks like electronically identifying them might be very difficult !
    - Industry seem to have taken simpler approach where it just shows the ppb or some version of it in the air. The sensors available in the market seems to react to any composition changes in the air.

# Focus of the project
- The aim of the project is to build something that could track the indoor air quality and have some environment sensors such as light sensor, Motion sensor and may be sound pressure sensor built in.
- The data should be collected periodically and shown on a display (display type will depends upon power source)
- The design of the sensor should be such that it blends in the room environment i.e. not flashy but not ugly either.
- it should be easy to mount and remove. If it is AA battery operated, changing the batteries should be an easy job.
- easy to 3d print or injection mold design.
- If possible it should be battery operated (could be Li-Ion or AA)
- The device has to be smart device i.e. IoT capable 2.4GHz 802.15.4 and Bluetooth support in the near future.
- If powered or chargeable it should be powered through USB-C
